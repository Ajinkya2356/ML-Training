Machine Learning Day 2

Nominal Data --> Used to label variables without providing any measurable value
Ordinal Data --> Categorical data with a set order or scale on it.
Discrete Data --> Data with final set of values which can be categorized
Continuous Data --> Can take any number from a range
y=mx+c ==> m = slope of line, c= y-intercept i.e. value of y when x=0

Matrix Operations
Addition,Substraction,Multiplication,Transponse,Determinant,Inverse

Eigen Vector -> The vectors that don't change their span while transformation.

Eigen Values -> The scalar values that are associated to the vectors

Population --> All objects whose properties are being observed
Parameter --> A metric that is used to represent a population characteristic

Linear Regression
Phone's Battery life and price
Independent --> price
Dependent --> Battery life
Study Hours and Marks
Independent --> Marks
Dependent --> Study Hours
Weight and strength
Independent --> strength
Dependent --> weight

1.Before using linear regression between two variables we are supposed to check correlation between them
2.Linear Regression can only be applied on continuous numerical datatype.
Simple Linear Regression is non causal
